# Rss-css-selectors
In this task, we will create a trainer for learning CSS selectors. The trainer consists of several game levels. Each level includes a layout example and HTML code that corresponds to the current level. Some layout elements are highlighted with animation. The user's task is to write a CSS selector that applies to all highlighted layout elements.The prototype of the trainer is the CSS Diner application, from which only the game part needs to be reproduced. Before starting the task, carefully familiarize yourself with the features of the prototype application, as this will speed up the task and facilitate understanding of its requirements.
